# Notes on Software Programming

> This is a collection of technolgies I have worked on till now. 

## Who am I?

My name is Khalid Ansari. I started software development in 2006 after graduating from IIT Kanpur, India. My first projects were in Java/J2EE after which I ventured into Salesforce/force.com at Accenture and then eventually into multiple projects from various stacks - MERN, Python/Django and ofcourse Java/J2EE, mainly at Toronto Stock Exchange (Part of a broader group called TMX Group).

## Why this blog?

Mainly to avoid rediscovering the same things over and over again. 

I found that I am taking notes on physical notebooks, text file on desktop, simplenote, github pages, etc. and the they are not well organized. I started to oraganize them in around 2015 and put them all on github using jykell templates. It worked but then I did so many customizations over the years that maintaining it was gettiing tougher which made me switch to docsify which gave all the options without customization which I needed. 

So this blog was for me to search and go back to for my needs but now it has grown is scope so may be it can help others. Mainly, on a few recent technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, VueJS, NoSQL DBs, Data Science, Docker, Kubernetes, GraphQL and AWS which clutter the IT world and can confuse the new comer, which shouldn't be the case as they are much easier to absorb once you get a high level view.
