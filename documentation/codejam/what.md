# What is Google Code Jam?

It is an annual coding competition where developers participate to access their coding skills at a global level. It is also used by Google to recruit top developers. I doubt that anyone participates in it for money as you can see the prizes [below](#prizes).

## Rounds

There are total of 5 rounds out of which the first 4 are online and the final is onsite. It is in Toronto this year, 2018. Last year it was in Ireland. Each programming problem is to be solved for two levels - level one is to solve them for a smaller range of numbers while level two is to solve them for large numbers

### Qualification Round

Code Jam starts with an online qualification round held over a weekend where you get around 27 hours to complete. Coders are presented with 4 programming problems. Each of which has two levels. Top 1000 coders will be selected for the next round - Round 1.

### Round 1

You get 3 chances to qualify this round - Round 1A, Round 1B and Round 1C. Each sub round is scheduled on someday of a weekend so if you miss 1A then you may appear for 1B the next weekend. Similarily, if you miss 1A and 1B that then you may appear for 1C the next weekend. Each sub round is presented with 3 programming problems and to qualify this round you need to be one of the 1000 top coders in either of these sub rounds. You get only 2.5 hours to complete each sub round.

### Round 2

Around 3000 coders reach this round - 1000 from 1A, 1000 from 1B and 1000 from 1C. It is generally less than this as most of the winners of the sub rounds are common. You are presented with 4 programming problems which are to be solved in 2.5 hours. Top 500 coders qualify to participate in round 3 while the next top 1000 get a T-shirt.


### Round 3

Around 500 coders reach this round. You are presented with 4 programming problems which are to be solved in 2.5 hours. Top 25 coders qualify to participate in the final round. Last year's winner is also included in the finals making a total of 26 contestants. This round is onsite and runs for 4 hours.
