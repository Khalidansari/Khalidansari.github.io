# User Interface

## skeuomorphism

When the web started, everybody tried to mimic the real world features on the web. Like heavy buttons with shadow and depth with some background image.

## Flat Design

The came the flat design which was a reaction to issues arising from skeuomorphism. Mobile issues, etc. As the users matured and recognised the digital patterns of the web, there was not much need for skeuomorphism and skeuomorphism started to feel clunky and out dated.

## Material Design

Was launched by google which is sort of a planned and good balance between skeuomorphism and flat design.
