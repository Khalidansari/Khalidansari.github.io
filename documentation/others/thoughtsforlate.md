## Non-linear systems

Though at first glance non-linear systems may look unstable but they are generally not. Loops and positive negative feedbacks can make a system stable to many a times. I visualize it from 2-3 perspectives. For programmers this intuition is more like writing recursion. Incorrect base conditions can lead to infinite loops which are more like unstable system. The other way to feel it is visualizing random things leading to bigger components of a image which keep growing bigger but then there are smaller parts/circles/knobs which are controlling them and making them stable. More like how hormones and other proteins keep sugar in our body stable though they all are affecting eachother through feedbacks.

I have a feeling that there are much more methods to be discovered there and applied than just dealing with linear system. Just like without recursion/iteration 90% of logic in programming might not work.

Need to start reading the literature for this.
