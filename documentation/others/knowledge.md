# What is Knowledge

## Scratching the Surface

Truth is objective but the knowledge of that truth is always related to conscious living being. To gain knowledge the conscious being has to go through the following steps:

1. Perceive through their senses

2. Store the information gained through their senses in their brain or devices. Sometimes the storage can be long term while at other times it can be short term.

3. Analyze the stored information in brain using brain. Short term memory can be used to conceptually understand a complex idea and a long term memory to be retrieved later with other information.

May be because the 1st step is perception through senses, we try to imagine abstract information by visualizing. We try to imagine ideas by having a visual representation of it somehow and at some level a sense of touch is involved as well. But its not very clear why don't we imagine them using taste or smell. May be because those senses are not able to quantifiable to an extent.


## Philosophy of Knowledge

The ideas here are taken from the book by Jennifer Nagel's A Very Short Introduction of Knowledge.


## Ideas which can be pondered upon later

1. To prove something in maths we have to assume it is true or false and then build further logic based on that to see if we fall into a conflict. If so then the assumption was incorrect and hence we reach a conclusion. Similarly we might assume that brain can figure out everything about itself. May be this assumption can provide some idea into how brain works/knowledge structure works.

Metonymy - Using different words for something similar. But this is not analogy. E.g. using press for the media organization or "pen is mightier than sword".
