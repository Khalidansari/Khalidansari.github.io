# Salesforce Shield

Mainly to maintain regulatory requirements. The data at rest is encrypted. The encryption decryption happens on application server which is physically away from database.

1. You can encrypt any existing fields using either your own key or a key generated by Salesforce.

2. Event Monitoring - A more exhaustive monitoring that existing "Audit Trail"

3. Field Audit Trail - Currently, it tracks only 20 fields per object and for only 18 months while this new feature can track it for 60 fields per object and for 10 years. Seems that we have to contact support to get it enabled.
