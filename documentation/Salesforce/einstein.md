# Salesforce Einstein

Different companies acquired by Salesforce are placed as different features in Salesforce.

Examples:

## Einstein Platform Services

Metamind became Salesforce Einstein platform services which is basically a language and vision analysis. You can fire REST webservices (Prediction API) passing it input and getting results like language sentiment analysis, intent and object names for which you will be charged. It is a pre-trained machine learning model. AWS offers a similar feature. Generally the price of training is kept low but that of using the model is more.
