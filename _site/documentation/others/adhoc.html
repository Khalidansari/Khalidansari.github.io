  <li>Permission Set License - Same as profile but can be assigned incrementally on user.</li>
  <li>Feature License - Generally can be assigned through a checkbox on user record or through some steps of configuration from setup</li>
  <li>Usage Based License -
  a. Persistent - Number of users who can login to portal. You assign permission once and they can login as many times. These persist with user.
  b. Non-persistent - Like credit card. How many records you can access per month (or yearly or it can be just once with no frequency)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="about-ip-masking-with-cidr-notation">About IP masking with CIDR notation</h2>

<p>Source: https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/access-control-policy</p>

<p>CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a way of indicating a range of IP addresses through masking. It applies to both IPv4 and IPv6. Here’s how it works. We’ll use IPv4 in our examples for simplicity.</p>

<p>IP addresses are groups of numbers separated by periods. In binary terms, each group is a specific number of bits (8 for IPv4 and 16 for IPv6). The IPv4 address 10.20.30.40 looks like this in binary:</p>

<p>00001010 . 00010100 . 00011110 . 00101000</p>

<p>That’s 4 groups of 8 bits, or 32 total bits. With CIDR, you can indicate a range by adding a /number (1-32) to the IP address, like this:</p>

<p>10.20.30.40/16</p>

<p>In this case, the 16 is the number you would use for the mask attribute value in this policy.</p>

<p>This notation means, “Keep the first 16 bits exactly as is, the remaining bits can be anything.”</p>

<h2 id="knights-tour">Knight’s tour</h2>

<p>Visiting all nodes by making a move of a knight. Special kind of hamiltonion cycle</p>

<h2 id="ores-theorem">Ore’s theorem</h2>

<p>Sufficiently large graphs are hamiltonion</p>

<h2 id="greedy-algorithm">greedy algorithm</h2>

<p>Try to solve a sub problem at individual step and this will solve the whole problem</p>

<h2 id="bézouts-identity">Bézout’s identity</h2>

<p>if GDC(a,b) = d then there exits X and Y such that aX + bY = d</p>

<h2 id="chinese-remainder-theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</h2>

<p>If one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime.</p>

<h2 id="euclidean-algorithm">Euclidean algorithm</h2>

<p>Find GDC of 102 and 38</p>

<p>GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a-b) or faster will be following =&gt; GCD(b, a%b)</p>

<ol>
  <li>102 % 38 = 26 =&gt; problem is reduced to finding GDC(26,38)</li>
  <li>38 % 26 = 12</li>
  <li>26 % 12 = 2</li>
  <li>12 %  2 = 0</li>
</ol>

<p>Hence 2 is the GDC</p>

<h2 id="extended-euclidean-algorithm">Extended Euclidean algorithm</h2>

<p>Working the Euclidean algorithm backwords to get the X and Y in:</p>

<p>aX + bY = GCD(a,b)</p>

<p>This is imp as this can be used to get mod inverse of a number if a and b are coprime i.e. GCD(a,b) = 1</p>

<h2 id="segmented-sieve">Segmented Sieve</h2>

<p>If the N is large then solving them usig sieve of Eratosthenes will be space consuming. So we break the range in smaller ranges or
length sqroot of N and then solve each.</p>

<h2 id="fermats-little-theorem">Fermat’s little theorem</h2>

<p>proof =&gt; gcd divides both a and b =&gt; ax + by is divisible by gcd =&gt; ax+by = k*GCD(a,b)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-algorithm-1">Greedy algorithm</h2>

<p>For some problems, making an optimal choice at every step might result in overall optimal choice. Not every problem can be solved greedily. They are more efficient than dynamic programming</p>

<h2 id="spanning-tree">Spanning tree</h2>

<p>A sub graph with minimum edges but all vertices. It has V-1 edges.</p>

<h2 id="mst---minimum-spanning-tree">MST - Minimum Spanning Tree</h2>

<p>This concept is in case of weighted graphs. This is the spanning tree with least sum of all weights of its edges.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic programming</h2>

<p>Solving problems iteratively rather than recursively. we can use tabulation (solving sub problems first - bottom up) or memoization (top down - storing solved problems in memory to be reused)</p>

<p>If a problem has optimal substructure then break it down and solve all sub problems. Store (memoize) the solution of the sub problems and use them through lookup when needed. It takes into account all subproblems before arriving at result while greedy method is assuming each step is linearly taking it closer to the final result. Check knapsack problem.</p>

<p>E.g. find min number of coins whose value = X. There are plenty of each coin. Let the value of coins be 1,3,5,10.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First you find this for value = 0</li>
  <li>Then find this for 1</li>
  <li>Then for 2</li>
  <li>Then for 3, etc.</li>
  <li>Keep updating at each step the optimal value. This can be used in the next step.</li>
</ol>

<p>Take another example of fibonacci calculation. Draw the graph of calculations and you will see some fib(n) multiple times. Dynamic programming will just store those and reuse than to calculate them again.</p>

<p>It is still brute force but in a intelligent way you are trying to reduce it from exponential to polynomial.</p>

<p>It needs two conditions - optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</p>

<p>Optimal substructure - Let us take shortest path in a graph as a problem. If a &gt; b has the shortest path p then any node ‘n’ on the path will have this property - shortest path from a &gt; n is part of path p.</p>

<p>overlapping subproblem - This can be taken care of by memoization. If overlap is not there then it is more like divide and conquer.</p>

<h2 id="topological-sort-subproblem-dependency-dag-directed-acyclic-graph-">Topological sort (Subproblem dependency DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) )</h2>

<p>Figuring out order of subproblem dependency. E.g. in fibonacci we know that to calculate F(n) calculate f(n-1) and f(n-2) first. So it is a simple order but it might not be always the case.</p>

<h2 id="memoization-is-an-issue-in-cyclic-graphs">Memoization is an issue in cyclic graphs</h2>

<h2 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h2>

<h2 id="brute-force">Brute-force</h2>

<h2 id="self-balancing-trees-are-mainly-binary-tree---each-node-can-have-at-most-2-children-also-called-sorted-or-ordered-tree">Self balancing trees (are mainly binary tree - each node can have at most 2 children) Also called sorted or ordered tree</h2>

<p>AVL &amp; Red Black are most common - As the elements are deleted or added, the tree rebalances it self to keep the height minimum. These trees help in binary search of elements which is faster.</p>

<p>Property =&gt; left child &gt; parent node &gt; right child</p>

<h2 id="theta-of-n">Theta of n</h2>

<p>Asymptotically equal. Same order is both lower as well as upper bound. No big or small.</p>

<h2 id="big-o">Big O</h2>

<p>Asymptotically less than or equal to. Small o is “less than”</p>

<h2 id="big-omega">Big Omega</h2>

<p>Asymptotically greater than or equal to. Small omega is “greater than”</p>

<h2 id="tn">T(N)</h2>

<p>is used to demonstrate the amount of work needed to be done for calculating function for n</p>

<h2 id="n-vs-np">N vs NP</h2>

<p>N = Problems which can be solved in polynomial time. Also, given the solution, we can see if its correct or wrong in polynomial time.</p>

<p>NP = Solution can be checked in polynomial.</p>

<p>It is called Nondeterministic Polynomial. Which means we can only find non deterministic solutions of order of polynomial.</p>

<p>NP Complete = Is a special class of NP problems which can all be converted to each other in polynomial time. They belong to NP class.</p>

<p>NP Hard = If it is NP Complete but not NP.</p>

<h2 id="random-access-machine">Random Access Machine</h2>
